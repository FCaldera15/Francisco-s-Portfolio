        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>hello! My name is Francisco Caldera, I was born in Dallas, TX but I have been living in Terrell, TX my whole
            life. While in high school I decided that I wanted to be a Math/ESL teacher, I started going to TVCC to work
            on my basics and then transered to Texas A&M Commerce to work on my degree. After some time i reflected on
            how my future would look like if I continued this path, and after going thru some classes I started to
            realize that I was not truly passionate about teaching and education is general was not doing so well. So I
            started to wonder what else I enjoyed doing and came to realize that I love computors and have always been
            fascinated of how people would make webpages, so that is the reason why I joined the SMU bootcamp in hope to
            find a new passion and have a more secure, favoritable future. </p>
